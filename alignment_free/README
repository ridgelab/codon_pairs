REQUIREMENTS:

cam.py uses Python version 2.7

Python libraries that must be installed include:
1. sys
2. multiprocessing
3. argparse
4. re
5. itertools
6. os
7. gzip (optional if using gzip files)
8. Bio.Seq,Bio.Alphabet

If any of those libraries is not currently in your Python Path, use the following command:
pip install --user [library_name]
to install the library to your path.

##########################

Input Files:
This algorithm requires two or more fasta files, or a directory which contains two or more fasta files.

Output File:
An output file is not required. If an output file is not supplied, the distance matrix will be written to standard out.

##########################

USAGE:

Typical usage requires the -i or the -id option. When using -i, input file names are space separated, 
with two or more files required. The algorithm will compare all sequences in all files to find 
all codon pairings within a ribosome footprint.

By default, all possible threads are used. If you want to change that, use the -t option.

By default, DNA sequences are expected. 

By default, the ribosome footprint size is 9 codons


Example usage:
python pairing_distance.py -id ../testFiles/mammals/ -o output
python pairing_distance.py -i ../testFiles/mammals/* > output


Running one of the above commands will produce a single output file called 'output' in the current directory.
This command should take under a minute on a single core. If your machine allows multithreading, it should finish much faster.
