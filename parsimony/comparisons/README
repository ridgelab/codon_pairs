############################

Purpose: Compare phylogenetic trees to reference trees using the ete compare module. Calculate the mean
	branch percent identity of all identical phylogenetic trees.

############################

Requirements:

The ete compare module is required. (http://etetoolkit.org/documentation/ete-compare/)

###########################

Usage:

Files in this comparisons directory contain programs to quickly compare TNT files of many maximum parsimony
	trees with a reference tree. It outputs a file of the ete comparisons for each input tree as well as the
	average branch percent identity. 

To perform the comparison, the findMeanComparison.sh script should be run with three additional parameters:
	the TNT file of phylogenetic trees, a path to the output file that will be created, and the path to
	the reference tree to be used for the comparisons.

Example usage:
./findMeanTreeComparison.sh /testFiles/plant_trees plant_comparisons /testFiles/plant_ref.nwk

Running the above command will produce an output file called plant_comparisons containing the output from 
	the ete comparisons. It will also calculate the mean branch percent identity and record this in the same
	output file.
